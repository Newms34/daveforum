DASHBOARD:
discord info

BUILD TEMPLATE:
change from on-hover to click 'inspect' button next to template.
Will show position:fixed; dialog with traits/skills
 - Allows us to inspect build elements

api doesnt seem to tell us guild server (makes sense, but still... :/ )

auto-ban via members removed from api/guild/members?

MEMBER SEARCH BAR!
5/17 meeting:-----------
SITE:
 - suggest/require account name? this'd allow us to ban (or remove) people who are removed from the guild
 - allow regular (non-mod) members to add calendar events? it *MAY* already do this
 - blog? I will *not* write for this, but could be a place to post vids ++ comment on em. ONLY MODS EDIT

GUILD:
 - What are we? PvE? PvX? WvW? 
 - suggest no more "lol pve bad" or "pve nerds" stuff. As harmless as it may seem, it's going to drive new players away

RECRUITING:
 - How are we recruiting? What's our process like?
 - Do we wanna limit it? Quantity or quality?
 - new is fine, but how do we wanna make sure they're

NOTES:

guild has grown in activity, not size <-- **good!**
