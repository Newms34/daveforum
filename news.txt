<b>PSA:</b>&nbsp;There will be no further updates to this site. I am pretty unhappy about working pro-bono on this and then being completely ignored in guild chat. I should not have to <i>beg</i> for a group in a guild of nearly 500 people, for an event that lasts nearly a month. If the site breaks from this point forward, too bad. The repo is on my github; you can fix it.
